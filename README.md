# Football-penalty-shootout
Football penalty shootout developed on Unity 3D
The kicker has the option to take shots in six total directions - top left, bottom left, top center, center, top right and bottom right corner.
The goalkeeper is controlled by the CPU.
If the shot direction =/= goalkeeper's save direction, then the kicker scores a goal.
Imported and worked on Adobe Mixamo's 'Shannon' character.
Built on Unity version 2019.4.21f1
