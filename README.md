# Football-penalty-shootout
Football penalty shootout developed on Unity 3D
The kicker has the option to take shots in six total directions - top left (numpad 1), bottom left (2), top center (5), center (6), top right (3) and bottom right corner (4).
The goalkeeper is controlled by the CPU.
If the shot direction =/= goalkeeper's save direction, the kicker scores a goal.
Imported and worked on Adobe Mixamo's 'Shannon' character.
Built on Unity version 2019.4.21f1
