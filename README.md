# Football-penalty-shootout
Football penalty shootout developed on Unity 3D. <br>
The kicker has the option to take shots in six total directions - top left (numpad 1), bottom left (2), top center (5), center (6), top right (3) and bottom right corner (4). <br>
The goalkeeper is controlled by the CPU. <br>
If the shot direction =/= goalkeeper's save direction, the kicker scores a goal. <br>
Imported and worked on Adobe Mixamo's 'Shannon' character. <br>
Built on Unity version 2019.4.21f1 <br>

There are two versions of this game: one has been built and takes input through numpad keys between 1 and 6. <br>
The other runs in Unity engine that takes hand signs as input through a python script. <br>
The python script is based on a VGG-16 CNN-based model developed by <a href="https://medium.com/@brenner.heintz">Brenner Heintz</a>.<br>
